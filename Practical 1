Practical 1

1A] Create a simple sequence based project. 
1. Create a blank project and, on the Design tab, in the File group, select New > Sequence. 
The New Diagram window is displayed. 
[Note: You can also add a Sequence activity to the Designer panel to create a new sequence.] 

2. In the Name field type a name for the automation, such as "First Sequence," and click 
Create. The Designer panel is updated accordingly. 

3. Create three String variables such as strFirstName, strLastName, and strHairColor, so 
that you can store data from the user in them. Leave the Default field empty, to indicate 
that there is no default value. 

4. Drag three Input Dialog activities to the Designer panel, one under the other. 

5. Select the first Input Dialog and, in the Properties panel, add a Label asking for the first 
name of the user, and a custom Title. 

6. In the Result field add the strFirstName variable. This indicates that this variable is going 
to be updated with the value added by the user at this point. 

7. Repeat steps 6 - 7 for the second and third Input Dialog activities to ask the user for his 
last name and hair color, and store them in the strLastName and strHairColor variables.
 
8. Add a Message Box activity under the third Input Dialog. 

9. Select the Message Box and, in the Properties panel, in the Text field, add the variables 
and a string to enable you to display all information gathered from the user, such as: 
strFirstName + " " + strLastName + " has " + strHairColor + " hair."

10. On the Design tab, in the File group, click Run. The automation is executed. The final 
output message should look as in the following screenshot. 

Conclusion : Thus we have studied to create a simple sequence based project.

1B] Create a flowchart-based project. 
1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new Blank Process named "FirstFlowchart".
 
2. Open Main.xaml, drag a Flowchart activity into the Designer panel. 

3. Create three String variables: strFirstName, strLastName, and strHairColor. 

4. Drag three Input Dialog activities into the Flowchart to collect first name, last name, and hair color. 
[Like this create for last name and haircolor] 

5.  Set Labels and Titles in each Input Dialog and store results in the corresponding variables.

6. Add a Message Box activity and set the text to strFirstName + " " + strLastName + " has " + 
strHairColor + " hair."

7. Connect all activities in sequence inside the Flowchart from Start to Message Box. 

8.  Click Run to execute the project and view the output.

Conclusion : Thus we have studied to  create  a flowchart-based project.

1C] Automate UiPath Number Calculation (Subtraction, Multiplication, Division of numbers). 
1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new Blank Process named "NumberCalculation".
 
2. Open Main.xaml, drag a Flowchart or Sequence activity into the Designer panel. 

3. Create four variables: num1 (Double), num2 (Double), subResult (Double), mulResult (Double), 
divResult (Double). 

4. Add two Input Dialog activities to get num1 and num2 from the user as strings.

5. Use Assign activities to convert inputs to Double using CDbl() (e.g., num1 = CDbl(strNum1)).
 
6. Add three Assign activities to calculate subResult = num1 - num2, mulResult = num1 * num2, 
divResult = num1 / num2. 

7. Add a Message Box to display all results: "Subtraction: " + subResult.ToString + vbNewLine + 
"Multiplication: " + mulResult.ToString + vbNewLine + "Division: " + divResult.ToString 

8. Click Run to execute and test with any numbers.

Conclusion : Thus we have studied how to create a Automate UiPath Number Calculation. 

1D] Create an automation UiPath project using different types of variables (number, datetime, 
Boolean, generic, array, data table)  
1. Number (Int32) 
Use an Assign activity to create myNumber = 10 (Type: Int32).

2. DateTime 
Use an Assign activity to create myDate = Now (Type: DateTime).

3. Boolean 
Use an Assign activity to create isEligible = myNumber > 5 (Type: Boolean). 

4. Generic Value 
Use an Assign activity to create myGeneric = "25" (Type: GenericValue).

5. Array: Use an Assign activity to create myArray = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"} (Type: Array of 
String). 

6. DataTable: Use a Build Data Table activity to create myTable with columns (Name, Age) and rows, 
then loop it using For Each Row in DataTable and add a Write Line to display: "Name: " + 
row("Name").ToString + ", Age: " + row("Age").ToString.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation UiPath project using different types of 
variables
