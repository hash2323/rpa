Practical 2

2A]
2A] Consider an array of names. We have to find out how many of them start with the 
letter "a". Create an automation where the number of names starting with "a" is. 
counted and the result is displayed. 
1. Create a new sequence in UiPath named CountNamesWithA.

2. Add an Assign activity to define namesArray = {"alice", "bob", "amy", "Alex", 
"john", "Annie"}. 

3. Add another Assign activity to initialize countA = 0. 

4. Insert a For Each activity to loop through namesArray with TypeArgument set to 
String. 

5. Inside the loop, add an If activity with condition item.ToLower.StartsWith("a"). 

6. In the Then block, add an Assign: countA = countA + 1.

7. After the loop, add a Message Box: "Number of names starting with 'a': " & 
countA.ToString. 

8. Run the workflow to display the count result. 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation where the number of names 
starting with "a" is. counted and the result is displayed.

2B] Demonstrate switch statement with an example. 
1. Use an Input Dialog activity to let the user select from Admin;Guest;User and store it in 
the userRole (Type: String) variable. 

2. Add a Switch activity with Expression: userRole and set TypeArgument to String. 

3. Add cases: "Admin", "User", "Guest" and a Default case for unrecognized roles.

4. Inside each case, add a Write Line activity to show a message like 
"Welcome, Guest” 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to demonstrate switch statement with an example. 

2C] Create an automation To Print numbers from 1 to 10 with break after the writeline 
activity inside for each activity. 
1. Assign → numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 10).ToArray (Type: Array of Int32) 

2. For Each → loop through numbers with loop variable num (TypeArgument: Int32) 

3. Write Line → num.ToString inside the loop

4. Break → Place immediately after Write Line to exit loop after printing the first number 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation To Print numbers from 1 to 
10 with break after the writeline activity inside for each activity. 

2D] Create an automation using Do..While Activity to print numbers from 5 to 1 
1. Create a new Process in UiPath Studio and name it appropriately. 

2. Drag a Sequence activity into the Main workflow to organize your actions. 

3. Create an Integer variable called counter and set its default value to 5.
 
4. Drag a Do...While activity inside the Sequence to implement the loop.
 
5. Inside the Do section, add a Write Line activity to display the current value of counter. 
6. Below that, add an Assign activity to decrement the counter by 1 (i.e., counter = 
counter - 1). 

7. Set the Do...While condition to counter >= 1 to continue the loop until 1. 

8. Run the workflow to see the numbers 5 to 1 printed in the Output panel. 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation using Do..While Activity to 
print numbers from 5 to 1. 

2E] Create an automation using Delay Activity between two writeline activities to 
separate their execution by 5 seconds 
1. Create a new Process in UiPath Studio and open the Main.xaml. 
2. Drag a Sequence activity onto the Designer panel to structure the workflow. 

3. Create an integer variable named counter and initialize it to 5. 

4. Drag a Do While activity inside the sequence to perform the countdown. 

5. Inside the Do While Body, first add a Delay activity and set Duration to 00:00:01 (1 
second pause). 

6. Below Delay, add a Write Line activity with counter.ToString to print the current 
number. 

7. Add an Assign activity below the Write Line to update the counter: counter = counter - 1.
 
8. Set the Do While condition to counter >= 1 to repeat until counter drops below 1.

9. Run the workflow, and it will print numbers from 5 to 1 with a 1-second 
delay between each. 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation using Delay Activity 
between two writeline activities to separate their execution by 5 seconds

2F] Create an automation to demonstrate use of decision statements (if) 
1. Use Input Dialog → Ask user to enter their age in a Text Box and store it in Agelimit 
(Type: String) 

2. Use If activity → Condition: Integer.Parse(Agelimit) > 18 

3. In Then block → Add Message Box: "You can Drive!" 

4. In Else block → Add Message Box: "You cannot drive!" 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied how to create an automation to demonstrate use of 
decision statements (if)
