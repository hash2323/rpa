Practical 6

6A]
A] Demonstrate the following activities in UiPath: 
i) Mouse (click, double click and hover) 
1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new Process.
 
2. Add a Sequence inside the Main workflow.
 
3. Use Application/Browser activity and set application path as 
C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe. 

4. Inside the Do container, add a Type Into activity and indicate the 
text area of Notepad. 

5. Type the text "Hello UI Path! This is demo for Click, Double 
Click, and Hover".

6. Add a Click activity and indicate the File menu in Notepad, set 
click type to Single and mouse button to Left. 

7. Add another Click activity and indicate the Maximize button of 
Notepad, set click type to Double and mouse button to Left. 

8. Add a Hover activity and indicate the Close button of Notepad.

ii) Type into 
1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new Process. 

2. Add a Sequence inside the Main workflow. 

3. Use Application/Browser activity and set application path as 
C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe. 

4. Inside the Do container, add a Type Into activity and indicate the 
text area of Notepad. 

5. Type the text "Hello UI Path! This is demo for Click, Double Click, 
and Hover".

Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate Mouse Events and 
Type into activity in UiPath.

B] Demonstrate the following Events in UiPath: 
i) Element triggering event 
1.  Open UiPath and create a new Process. 

2.  Drag and drop Trigger Scope activity into the sequence. 

3.  Inside Trigger Scope → add Click Trigger activity. 

4.  Indicate the Notepad text area (or any clickable area inside 
Notepad) as the target element. 

5.  Select Mouse Button as BTN_LEFT. 

6.  Go to Actions panel → add a Sequence. 

7.  Inside the Sequence → drag Use Application/Browser activity and 
select Notepad  (C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe). 

8.  Inside Do block → add Type Into activity. 

9.  Indicate the text area of Notepad. 

10.  Enter text → "Hello UI Path". 

11.  After that, add a Message Box activity. 

12.  Enter text → "Click Event Triggered". 

13.  Run the workflow → when you click in Notepad (on the selected 
element), text will be typed and the message box will appear.

ii) Image triggering event 
1. Open UiPath and create a new Process. 
2. Drag and drop Trigger Scope activity into the sequence. 

3. Inside Trigger Scope → add Click Image Trigger activity.
 
4. Indicate the image on screen (e.g., the picture shown in your 
workflow). 

5. Select Mouse Button as BTN_LEFT. 

6. Go to Actions panel → add a Sequence. 

7. Inside the Sequence → add a Message Box. 

8. Enter text → "Image Triggered".

9. Run the workflow → when the image is clicked, the trigger fires 
and shows the message.

iii) System Triggering Event 
1. Open UiPath and create a new Process. 

2. Drag and drop Trigger Scope activity into the sequence. 

3. Inside Trigger Scope → add System Trigger activity.
 
4. Set TriggerInput → select both Keyboard and Mouse. 

5. Go to Actions panel → add a Sequence.

6. Inside the Sequence → drag Use Application/Browser activity and 
select Notepad (C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe). 

7. Inside Do block → add Type Into activity. 

8. Indicate editable text area in Notepad. 

9. Enter text → "Hello Swayam". 

10.  After that, add a Message Box. 

11.  Enter text → "System Triggered". 
12.  Run the workflow → when keyboard/mouse input happens, 
Notepad opens, types text, and message box appears. 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate triggerring events in 
UiPath
