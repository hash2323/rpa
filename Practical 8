Practical 8
8A]
A] Read Pdf with OCR. 
Steps: 
1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new process. 

2.  Drag and drop the Read PDF with OCR activity into the 
workflow. 

3. In the File Name property, provide the path of the PDF file (e.g., 
"C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Offer Letter.pdf"). 

4.  Select Tesseract OCR as the OCR engine to extract text. 

5.  Create a variable (e.g., scrap_data) to store the extracted text. 

6.  After the OCR activity, add a Message Box activity. 

7.  In the Text property of the Message Box, write 
scrap_data.ToString. 

8. Run the workflow: UiPath will read the PDF file using OCR and 
display the extracted text in a message box.

Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate Read Pdf with OCR 
Activity in UiPath
 
B] Demonstrate Exception Handling Using UiPath 
Steps: 
1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new process. 

2. Create a variable named “Array” of type Int32[] and assign default 
value {10, 20}.

3. Create another variable named “i” of type Int32 and assign default 
value -1. 

4. Drag and drop a Sequence activity into the workflow. 

5. Insert a Try Catch activity inside the sequence. 

6. In the Try block, add a Message Box with text Array(i).ToString. 

7. In the Catch block, set exception type as: 
System.IndexOutOfRangeException. 

8. Add a Message Box in the Catch block with text:  
Exception.ToString. 

9. In the Finally block, add a Message Box with text "Exception 
Handled". 

10. Run the workflow to see exception handling execution. 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate Exception Handling 
Using UiPath.
