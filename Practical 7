Practical 7

7A]
A] Automate the following screen scraping method using UiPath: 
i) Full Text  
Steps:  
1. Use Open Browser to navigate to Amazon Electronics page. 

2. Add Get Text activity and indicate the element (“Electronics”). 

3. Save the output to a variable (scrapdata). 

4. Use Message Box to display scrapdata.ToString. 
 
Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate Full Text method in 
UiPath

B) Demonstrate Data Scraping and display values in Message box    
using OCR. 
Steps: 
1. Open UiPath Studio and create a new process. 

2. Drag and drop the Use Application/Browser activity and select 
Chrome browser. 

3. In the Browser URL property, enter chrome://newtab/. 

4. Inside the Do container, add a Get OCR Text activity.
 
5. Indicate the target area in the Chrome window where you want to 
scrape text. 

6. Select Tesseract OCR Engine as the OCR method. 

7. Create a variable (e.g., variable1) to store the extracted text output.

8. After the OCR activity, add a Message Box activity. 

9. In the Text property of the Message Box, pass the variable name 
with .ToString. 

10. Run the workflow → it will scrape text from the browser and 
display it in the message box. 

Conclusion: Thus we have studied to demonstrate Data Scraping Using 
OCR in UiPath.
